# InnoSetup.FileUtils

Few utilies for files, fileage and systemtime. Some might be useful to others. 

Main reason to write these utils was that I will need to do some pruning of files, by age, in installer, which I addmit, is not tht common task for isntaller. I need it to get rid of potentially huge backups, that are too old to be usebful anymore. 

Some code based on Stack overflow response which I can't find anymore (will link and give credits if/when find it).
